## Research

"My final project is to create a robot that picks up Pickle -balls. I enjoy working out in the morning at our YMCA.  The indoor tennis court is diretly beside the pickle-ball court.  One day I saw my former P.E. insttructor practicing serves, and I thought it would be convenient for the YMCA to have a robot collect the balls on the court."

> "FIRST competitions often have middle and high school students create a robot to gather and shoot items, so I had a starting point for research."

## Code Example

Use the three backticks to separate code.

```
// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
}
```
